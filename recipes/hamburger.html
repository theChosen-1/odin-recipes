    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A simple cheese hamburger is a timeless classic loved for its satisfying, no-fuss combination of flavors. 
    At its core, it features a juicy beef patty grilled or pan-fried to perfection, topped with a slice of melted 
    cheese—usually cheddar—tucked between a soft, lightly toasted burger bun. The heat from the patty melts the cheese 
    just enough to create a creamy, savory layer that blends beautifully with the meat.</p>

    <p>This humble burger is often dressed with classic toppings like crisp lettuce, sliced tomato, onions, pickles, 
    ketchup, and mustard, though it can be enjoyed plain as well. It’s the perfect balance of savory, salty, and slightly 
    tangy elements in every bite—ideal for a quick meal, backyard barbecue, or diner-style comfort food experience.</p>
